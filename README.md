## Roadmap

* **Version 2.0.2** (May 2018): 
Bugs fixed on the basis of the received comments on link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/issues[GitHub] about versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1. The release contains a definition of all relevant link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/doc[business rules] and corresponding link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/val/schematron[schematron files] to validate Regulate and Self-Contained ESPD Request and Response XML instances (including the validation of the criteria taxonomy). A corresponding link:http://isaitb2.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/espd/upload[TestBed for version 2.0.2] has been set up. Other major artefacts of this release are link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/xslt/Versions_1-2_Mapping[conversion style-sheets from version 1.0.3 to version 2.0.2]. The specifications for version 2.0.2 contain an updated link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist[distribution] of the ESPD Exchange Data Model and include a corresponding link:https://espd.github.io/ESPD-EDM/v2.0.2/xml_guide.html[implementation guideline] which clarifies the ESPD validation architecture in link:https://espd.github.io/ESPD-EDM/v2.0.2/xml_guide.html#annex-i-xml-validation[Annex I] and the conversion from ESPD EDM version 1.0.3 to ESPD EDM version 2.0.2 in link:https://espd.github.io/ESPD-EDM/v2.0.2/xml_guide.html#annex-ii-v1-0-3-to-v2-0-2-conversion[Annex II].  Also, the link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0.2[BIS 41 â€“ ESPD version 2.0.2] was updated accordingly.

* **Version 1.0.2 errata**
The [ESPD EDM version 1.0.2 errata](https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2-Revision/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/CriteriaTaxonomy-V1.0.2-errata.ods) contains corrections of the existing specifications which were needed to have an accurate baseline. The documentation was revised according to the changes that were made to the Commission ESPD service until July 2017. All corrections relate to the Criteria Data Flows and result in a revision of the criteria taxonomy for version 1.0.2 (see the file mentioned about link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2-Revision/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/CriteriaTaxonomy-V1.0.2-errata.ods[ESPD EDM version 1.0.2 errata] where revisions are marked within the sheet, see tab "Change Log"). No other change was done to the ESPD EDM version 1.0.2. The revisions have no impact on current ESPD services based on v1.0.2 but we recommend using the revised criteria taxonomy to approve the correct Criteria Data Flows. 

* **Version 1.0.3** (April 2018): Minor documentation fixes applied to version 1.0.2. The data model was not changed.  Only the documentation was updated to reflect the changes made until the July 2017 release of the Commission ESPD. It has no impact on current ESPD services based on v1.0.2. The update criteria taxonomy can be found here: ./dist/cl/ods/ESPD-CriteriaTaxonomy(Data-Structures)_V1.0.3.ods[Criteria Taxonomy (Data Structures)]. See also documentation about v2.0.2 chapter "I.5 Forward compatibility").

* **Version 2.0.1** (Jan. 2018): Bug fixes detected in the previous versions; change requests related to these bugs were collected in this Github Issues space (see Issues for the details. See also the Release Notes above and the 'dist/rn' folder for details on those issues related to v2.0.2 that have been closed). 

* **Version 2.0.0** (Sept. 2017): The goal of version 2.0.0 is that the ESPD-EDM is self contained. Meaning that public buyers can specify directly in their ESPD services criteria instead of defining them in the procurement document or the notice. Examples are that the public buyer can specify the number of years needed for the turnovers, the financial ratios needed for the procedure or that they can specify certificates needed. Something else that will be implemented in version 2.0.0 is the possibility to weight criteria which is important to reduce the number of participants in a procedure. Issues for this release are:
  * https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/issues/

* **Version 1.0.2**: Version 1.0.2 has no impact on current implementation. It was published in July 2016. It fixes the issue: 
  * https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/issues/2
  
* **Version 1.0.1**: Version 1.0.1 is used since December 2015. This version is based on UBL 2.1.

## Installation

The recommended way to get started using the `exchange-model` in a `Java` project is with a dependency management system.

### With Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>eu.europa.ec.grow.espd</groupId>
  <artifactId>exchange-model</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### With Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile("eu.europa.ec.grow.espd:exchange-model:1.0.2")
}
```

### Version 2.0.2

**Please note that this version requires Java 8**

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>eu.europa.ec.grow.espd</groupId>
  <artifactId>exchange-model2</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Version 2 of the `Exchange Model` has a different `artifactId`, i.e. `exchange-model2`, in order to support 
the usage of both versions at the same time inside a `Java` `Maven` project.

In order to use the snapshot version, you might have to enable the `Maven` snapshot repository in your `pom.xml`.


```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>oss-sonatype</id>
    <name>oss-sonatype</name>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```
