=== I.1 Introduction to ISO Schematron

http://www.schematron.com/[Schematron] is a rule-based validation language to specify validation processes against XML documents. Schematron is an ISO (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2006) and open standard.

ESPD uses Schematron to validate business rules identified in https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/doc[ESPD_TestCases_v10.docx and ESPD_TestCases_mapping_v10.docx documents]. 
These business rules can be typified as:

. *Semantic validations*: e.g. The "cac:TenderingCriterionResponse" matches one of the "cac:TenderingCriterionProperty" elements in the XML.

. *Assertions* about the presence or absence of patterns in XML documents: e.g. All Business Rules that applies to identifier nodes: mandatory attributes, structure of the identifier, etc.

. *Code lists* validations: e.g. values for each code list element.

. *Other validations* that an XSD cannot do: e.g. Validates that one of the nodes has at least 1 child.


The following image shows different examples of validations:

The validation of code lists is explained in sections below.
