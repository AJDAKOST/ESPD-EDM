==== Mock-ups - economic operator perspective

Notice that, as for the exclusion criteria, for the selection criteria the MS can specify general national sub-criteria in e-Certis. Software applications can download these sub-criteria from e-Certis and shown them in their GUI. For each national sub-criteria, the economic operator will have to respond "Yes" or "No" to confirm that it fulfills them.
