
=== III.11 Lots - Self-contained ESPD

[cols="<1,<4"]
|===
|*REQUIREMENT*
|The contracting authority needs to be able to specify the following information: (i) The Lots into which the procedure is divided; (ii) To which lots the tenders may be submitted (all lots, maximum number of lots, only one lot); and (iii) The maximum number of lots that may be awarded to one tenderer.
|===
 
==== Mock-up
This mock-up shows how this could be implemented:

.Lots (Selfcontained ESPD), mock-up

==== XSD Schema
*REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED* ESPD documents share the same UBL-2.2 XSD Schemas (there are not two different sets of XSD Schemas). Thus, for the identification of the Lots, the Self-contained ESPD uses the same component than for the Regulated ESPD:

.cac:ProcurementProjectLot. XSD Schema
image::ProcurementProjectLot.png[Lots, alt="Lots", align="center"]

The rest of information about the lots (“tenders must be submitted for…”, “maximum number of lots”, “maximum number of lots that may be awarded”) is treated as the elements (or properties) of a “Criterion” (component `cac:TenderingCriterion`) named “Additional information about the Lots”.  As this structure is dealt with further on in this guide. See sections about exclusion and selection for details about it.
